        <h2> Senior Project </h2>
		    <p>In this project, my partner and I made a rhythm game settled in outer
        	space. Using the arrow keys, play to the beat of the music to evade
            meteors and shoot down enemy spaceships.

        <h2> Game Development Project </h2>
		    <p>As a team of 6, we created a first person shooter, platforming game.
        	The first level is where the user must jump over the crates to reach 
            the ladder to move on to the second level. In the second level, enemy
            pirates board the ship and the user must eliminate them and reach the
            escape pod.
        </p>

        <h2> Computer Graphics Project </h2>
		    <p>We created a scene in 3D that the user can walk around. It is an island
        	made of blocks, similar to minecraft, with randomized terrain every
            time the user runs the scene.
